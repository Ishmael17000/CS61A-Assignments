Discussion:
The problem is that, the function counts by minutes, which doesn't detect the time between integer minutes.
For example, when x is irrational and y is rational, they never meet at time>0, so race() runs forever.
Even if x and y has a common multiplierï¼Œ when 2x doesn't divide y, the first few encounters will be omissed."""
